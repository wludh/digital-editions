            <p>The influenza pandemic of 1918-19 affected even those living in rural areas such as <placeName id="#RHSP-0002">Rockbridge County</placeName> and its two cities, <placeName id="#RHSP-0003">Lexington</placeName> and <placeName id="#RHSP-0004">Buena Vista</placeName>. Local newspapers and other local sources were used to construct a chronology of events. Concomitant national and global events are included in order to visualize how local history fit into those events. Morbidity and mortality rates were estimated using vital statistics and local sources. Relevance of local <date when="1918">1918</date> events to future pandemic preparations is also discussed.</p>

                <p>Certain high-risk groups are susceptible to more severe complications and even death. Before <date when="1918">1918</date>, influenza was viewed by the medical community as an inconvenience.<note n="3" place="foot" type="author">Alfred W.

                <p>The pandemic of <date when="1918">1918</date> changed that view of influenza. Unlike other outbreaks before it, the <date when="1918">1918</date> virus preyed on the young and healthy and without regard to skin color or socioeconomic status. More than half of all deaths occurred in young adults between the ages of twenty and forty, and the worst mortality figures were in the twenty- to thirty-year-old cohort<note n="4" place="foot" type="author">Alfred W.

The influenza first appeared at <placeName id="#RHSP-0014">Camp Lee</placeName> on Sept. 13; Sept. 21st, a week later, <num type="cardinal" value="1539">one thousand five hundred thirty-nine</num> cases had been reported. The majority of the men who first contracted it had already recovered and returned to duty. But six had died from pneumonia which had set in after the enfluenza.

                    <p>Spanish influenza, rapidly spreading throughout the country, is . . . a highly infectious disease caused by a particularly energetic germ. . . . It is in enormous numbers in the bronchial mucus, whence it is coughed up to renew its pernicious work. . . . It exerts such a general devitalizing effect on the tissue that other dangerous micro-organisms which ordinarily are held in check run riot and catarrh, pneumonia, and similar conditions develop. It particularly attacks overworked and weakened organs such as the heart and lungs. For this reason, rest, nutrition, warmth and tonics are important factors in its treatment.</p>
                    <p>The <date when="1918-09-28">September 28</date> <bibl><title>Staunton Daily News</title></bibl> published a colorful and <soCalled>âimportant statementâ</soCalled> from the state health commissioner in response to the <soCalled>âalarming increaseâ</soCalled> of cases in <placeName id="#RHSP-0032">Virginia</placeName>: <q>âDon't spit in anybody's face and don't let anybody spit in yours!â In addition, âBetter by far if they whacked us on the head with a stick instead of spraying us with his disease-producing spit . . . . And may we also be saved from the common drinking cup â another menace almost as bad as the coughers and sneezers.â</q></p>

                    <p>This order of the board of health was neither due to the presence of a plague nor a panic in <placeName id="#RHSP-0003">Lexington</placeName>.

                <p>Nationally, nearly half of all deaths in <date when="1918">1918</date> resulted from influenza.<note n="147" place="foot" type="author">Alfred W. Crosby, America's Forgotten Pandemic: The Influenza of 1918 (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2003), p. 204.</note> The <placeName id="#RHSP-0004">Buena Vista</placeName> statistics support the national estimates.

In fact, <placeName id="#RHSP-0002">Rockbridge County</placeName> death rates for influenza, especially during the fall wave in <date when="1918">1918</date>, are possibly underestimates owing to underreporting or failure to determine causes of death accurately.</p>

                <p>Because the diagnoses of influenza and pneumonia in <date when="1918">1918</date> were not based on objective laboratory testing or case identification, statistics for influenza and pneumonia were combined to see if there was a difference when compared with the statistics for influenza alone.

                <p>A pandemic of the magnitude of the <date when="1918">1918</date> pandemic would cause economic stress, although the availability of antiviral therapies, vaccines, antibiotics, and rapid identification of cases would have an impact on morbidity and mortality.<note n="149" place="foot" type="author">John M. Barry, The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague in History (Viking, New York, 2004), pp. 450-52.</note> In contrast to the lack of communication in <date when="1918">1918</date>, communication today is much faster due to myriad forces, including internet and social networking.<note n="150" place="foot" type="author">John S.

                <p>There are important lessons to be learned from the <date when="1918">1918</date> pandemic in <placeName id="#RHSP-0002">Rockbridge County</placeName>. At that time, help from state and federal government was not available; communities had to take care of themselves. This approach included using volunteers and family members as caregivers to compensate for inadequate numbers of medical personnel. Locally, hospitals were improvised, using firehouses, hotels, dormitories, and private residences. Elsewhere in <placeName id="#RHSP-0032">Virginia</placeName>, schools were used as hospitals in some locations and medical students were deployed.<note n="152" place="foot" type="author">Lawrence O. Gostin, âInfluenza Pandemic Preparedness: Legal and Ethical Dimensions,â in Hastings Center Report, September-October 2004, pp. 10-11; Gostin, âMedical Countermeasures for Pandemic Influenza: Ethics and the Law,â in Journal of the American Medical Association, February 2006, pp. 554-56; Virginia Department of Health, 2005.</note></p>
                <p>Questions regarding pandemic flu planning include whether to send college students home and, if so, when. Statistics on morbidity and mortality in <placeName id="#RHSP-0003">Lexington</placeName>'s two colleges were available only for <placeName id="#RHSP-0007">W&amp;amp;L</placeName>, where <num type="percentage" value="35">thirty-five percent</num> to <num type="percentage" value="40">forty percent</num> percent of the student population fell ill and two students died 
                <pb n="266"/>
                from influenza. There is no question that the extent of illness in the student population taxed health-care resources locally.</p>
                <p>Discussions regarding pandemic preparations today deal with similar issues of school closings, economic impact, quarantining, local community involvement, utilization of volunteers, importance of communication with the public, and basic prevention, such as respiratory etiquette and hand-washing.<note n="153" place="foot" type="author">Teddi D.
