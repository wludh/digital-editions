            <p>The influenza pandemic of 1918-19 affected even those living in rural areas such as <placeName id="#RHSP-0002">Rockbridge County</placeName> and its two cities, <placeName id="#RHSP-0003">Lexington</placeName> and <placeName id="#RHSP-0004">Buena Vista</placeName>. Local newspapers and other local sources were used to construct a chronology of events. Concomitant national and global events are included in order to visualize how local history fit into those events. Morbidity and mortality rates were estimated using vital statistics and local sources. Relevance of local 1918 events to future pandemic preparations is also discussed.</p>

                <head>History of Influenza and Pandemics</head>
                <p>The word <soCalled>âinfluenzaâ</soCalled> comes from the Italian <foreign xml:lang="it">influenza di freddo</foreign>, <soCalled>âinfluence of the cold,â</soCalled> referring to the usual cases that occur each winter.1 Symptoms2 of <soCalled>âthe fluâ</soCalled> (or <soCalled>âthe <foreign xml:lang="it">grippe</foreign></soCalled>â) come on suddenly, within a day or two after contact, and include high fever (sometimes with delirium), headache, respiratory symptoms, and muscle and bone aches.</p>
                <p>Certain high-risk groups are susceptible to more severe complications and even death. Before 1918, influenza was viewed by the medical community as an inconvenience.3 When it killed, the cause was most often opportunistic bacterial invaders that caused pneumonia, especially in the elderly and the weak.</p>
                <p>The pandemic of 1918 changed that view of influenza. Unlike other outbreaks before it, the 1918 virus preyed on the young and healthy and without regard to skin color or socioeconomic status. More than half of all deaths occurred in young adults between the ages of twenty and forty, and the worst mortality figures were in the twenty- to thirty-year-old cohort4 â the group that included soldiers and young parents. The <placeName id="#RHSP-0002">Rockbridge County</placeName> experience was no different.</p>
                <p>Pandemics, by definition, involve the whole world.5 A pandemic implies a novel virus strain, serious ill effects, and sustained person-to-person transmission. Because little or no immunity to the new strain exists, individuals are very susceptible to it. Because the incubation period of influenza is so short, it spreads quickly. High levels of ill
                <pb n="236"/>
                ness, death, social disruption, and economic loss are associated with any pandemic.6</p>
                <p>There were three major pandemics of influenza in the twentieth century: the 1968-69 Hong Kong flu (750,000 deaths worldwide); the 1957-58 Asian flu (1 million deaths worldwide); and the 1918-19 Spanish flu, with an estimated <num type="cardinal" value="50000000">fifty million</num> to <num type="cardinal" value="100000000">one hundred million</num> deaths worldwide.7 Further, some 1918 residents of <placeName id="#RHSP-0002">Rockbridge County</placeName> would have remembered, or may even have been exposed to, the Russian flu of 1889-90.</p>
                <p>In 1918, nearly a third of the world's population, including that of the <placeName id="#RHSP-0011">United States</placeName>, had symptoms.* About <num type="percentage" value="40">forty percent</num> percent of Navy personnel and <num type="percentage" value="36">thirty-six percent</num> percent of Army soldiers became ill.9 Over all, an estimated <num type="cardinal" value="675000">six hundred seventy-five thousand</num> Americans died;10 nearly half of all <placeName id="#RHSP-0011">U.S.</placeName> deaths in 1918 were due to influenza.11 Influenza affected life span statistics dramatically: In 1917, the life expectancy of the average American was fifty-one years; in 1918, it was thirty-nine years.12</p>
                <p>Unique to the 1918 strain, death rates reached <num type="percentage" value="2.5">two and a half percent</num> percent to <num type="percentage" value="5">five percent</num> percent,13 up to fifty times the mortality seen in other influenza outbreaks. In some locations in the world, even those death rates were greatly exceeded.14</p>
                <p>Influenza deaths obtained from the Department of Vital Statistics for <placeName id="#RHSP-0032">Virginia</placeName> for the years 1913 through 1928 are shown in Figure 1. There was an approximately seventeen-fold increase in the number of deaths from 1917 to 1918. The number of deaths did not return to pre-1918 levels until 1921. The tail end of the pandemic of 1918-19 occurred in 1920.</p>

                <p>Three newspapers in <placeName id="#RHSP-0002">Rockbridge County</placeName> at the time served as sources of information about the war and local news: the <bibl><title>Rockbridge County News</title></bibl>,the <bibl><title>Lexington Gazette</title></bibl>, and the <bibl><title>Buena Vista Weekly</title></bibl>. A railroad depot in <placeName id="#RHSP-0004">Buena Vista</placeName> served as a hub for travel to and from locations outside the county.</p>
                <p><placeName id="#RHSP-0002">Rockbridge County</placeName> did not escape the terrible impact of the <q>âmother of all pandemics.â</q>15 Yet the impact of the first wave in the spring was minimal to nonexistent. As in the rest of the world the fall 1918 wave was horrific.16 The local newspapers reported that the effects of the pandemic continued to be felt in early 1919 and again in early 1920.</p>

                    deep snow and thick ice everywhere. Activities of all kinds were paralyzed.18 On <date when="1918-01-01">January 1</date>, it was four degrees below zero. Fuel was scarce. Businesses were closed on Mondays to save fuel. There was a sugar shortage.</p>
                    <p>Residents of <placeName id="#RHSP-0002">Rockbridge County</placeName> had no idea that the first wave of the pandemic had already begun; they were spared its fury. In late January, while they were coping with record cold temperatures, unusually virulent cases of influenza were observed halfway across the country in <placeName id="#RHSP-0012">Haskell County, Kansas</placeName>.19 By April, thousands were sick at <placeName id="#RHSP-0013">Camp Funston, Kansas</placeName>, where it was extremely cold and very overcrowded.</p>
                    <p>Locally, March was a <q>âsmiling and beautiful month.â</q> Now that the weather was better, <placeName id="#RHSP-0002">Rockbridge County</placeName> parents visited their sons in military camps, especially <placeName id="#RHSP-0014">Camp Lee</placeName>, near <placeName id="#RHSP-0015">Richmond</placeName>. County residents were preoccupied with the war and with buying Liberty Bonds. A great crowd, including <num type="cardinal" value="5000">five thousand</num> visitors from all over the county and <placeName id="#RHSP-0004">Buena Vista</placeName>, gathered in <placeName id="#RHSP-0003">Lexington</placeName> on Saturday, <date when="1918-04-06">April 6</date>, to participate in the Liberty Loan parade, described by the <bibl><title>Gazette</title></bibl> as a <q>âmonster parade.â</q></p>
                    <p>Attention was directed to getting huge numbers of American troops to <placeName id="#RHSP-0016">Europe</placeName>.20 Outbreaks all over <placeName id="#RHSP-0016">Europe</placeName> were epidemiologically associated with <placeName id="#RHSP-0011">U.S.</placeName> troop embarkations.21 The flu was very contagious among the troops and was called <q>âthree-day feverâ</q> in <placeName id="#RHSP-0016">Europe</placeName>.22 The name <soCalled>âSpanish

                    <p>A number of crowded military camps experienced epidemics in March and April. In mid-April, <placeName id="#RHSP-0002">Rockbridge County</placeName> residents read about the death of a <persName id="#RHS-0002">Private Turner</persName>, age twenty-one, of <placeName id="#RHSP-0018">Fancy Hill</placeName>, from unspecified pneumonia while at <placeName id="#RHSP-0001">Camp Greene, North Carolina</placeName>. Of interest, there were still no reported cases of flu or pneumonia among <placeName id="#RHSP-0002">Rockbridge County</placeName> residents.</p>
                    <p>Little attention was paid in general to outbreaks of the flu in the <placeName id="#RHSP-0011">United States</placeName> â in <num type="cardinal" value="1000">one thousand</num> Ford Motor <choice><expan>Company</expan><abbr>Co.</abbr></choice> workers, in <num type="cardinal" value="500">five hundred</num> prisoners at <placeName id="#RHSP-0019">San Quentin</placeName>, or in many other population centers all over the nation.24 The spring epidemic was not even mentioned in the <bibl><title>Journal of the American Medical Association</title></bibl>.25</p>
                    <p>Unknown to <placeName id="#RHSP-0002">Rockbridge County</placeName> residents, however, physicians elsewhere were beginning to observe26 that influenza-related pneumonia was killing an unusually large number of young adults. At the same time, there was a substantial increase in symptoms such as blackened lips and hemorrhaging from the nose, and also in quick death and unusual autopsy findings. The significance of these phenomena would not be appreciated until many more examples were seen in <q>âthe terrible autumnâ</q> of 1918.</p>
                    <p>As of <date when="1918-07-22">July 22</date>, <placeName id="#RHSP-0002">Rockbridge County</placeName> had <num type="cardinal" value="677">six hundred seventy-seven</num> men in the armed forces. By August, the Spanish Flu had probably killed tens of thousands worldwide, but local residents were exposed only to the heat in early August: <num type="cardinal" value="101">one hundred one</num> degrees in <placeName id="#RHSP-0003">Lexington</placeName>.27</p>

                    <p>In the latter part of August, the influenza virus mutated, resulting in explosive epidemics in three port cities thousands of miles apart28 â locations marked by mixing of military and local populations. One of these port cities was in the <placeName id="#RHSP-0011">United States</placeName>, where flu surfaced in <placeName id="#RHSP-0020">Boston</placeName> on <date when="1918-08-27">August 27</date>. (The other port cities were <placeName id="#RHSP-0021">Freeport in Sierra Leone</placeName> and <placeName id="#RHSP-0022">Brest in France</placeName>.) Flu struck <placeName id="#RHSP-0023">Camp Devens</placeName>, thirty miles west of <placeName id="#RHSP-0020">Boston</placeName>, on <date when="1918-09-07">September 7</date>, then spread to other installations, including <placeName id="#RHSP-0014">Camp Lee</placeName> in <placeName id="#RHSP-0032">Virginia</placeName>. By <date when="1918-09-23">September 23</date>, influenza was reported among civilians throughout the mid-Atlantic states, with scattered cases elsewhere throughout the country.</p> 
                    <p>Meanwhile, early September was quiet in <placeName id="#RHSP-0003">Lexington</placeName>. Appeals from the government to save gasoline because of shortages resulted in quiet Sundays in <placeName id="#RHSP-0003">Lexington</placeName>.29 If the <placeName id="#RHSP-0002">Rockbridge County</placeName> newspapers had been the only news sources, residents would not have known that the second â and more deadly â wave of influenza was already heading their way.</p>
                    <p>And the war in <placeName id="#RHSP-0016">Europe</placeName> continued. By <date when="1918-09-12">September 12</date>, a total of <num type="cardinal" value="2590">two thousand five hundred ninety</num>

                    <p>The university registrar's office opened on <date when="1918-09-24">September 24</date>, a day earlier than usual, with 146 young men enrolling on that first day. <persName id="#RHS-0003"><abbr>Drs.</abbr> Robert Glasgow</persName> and <persName id="#RHS-0004">Reuben Frank Davis</persName>, <placeName id="#RHSP-0003">Lexington</placeName> physicians, performed physicals on more than 500 men who poured into <placeName id="#RHSP-0003">Lexington</placeName> throughout the week.

Thus did most local residents first become aware of the extent of the epidemic, particularly in the camps:</p>
                    <p>The disease known as Spanish enfluenza, so prevalent in <placeName id="#RHSP-0017">Spain</placeName> early in the year and which has effected many of our soldiers in <placeName id="#RHSP-0027">France</placeName> has become widely prevalent in this country . . . .

The majority of the men who first contracted it had already recovered and returned to duty. But six had died from pneumonia which had set in after the enfluenza. Saturday there was also reported fourteen deaths, as a result of the enfluenza at <placeName id="#RHSP-0028">Camp Dix, <choice><expan>New Jersey</expan><abbr>N.J.</abbr></choice></placeName>, and at <placeName id="#RHSP-0023">Camp <choice><sic>Devins</sic><corr>Devens</corr></choice>, <choice><expan>Massachusetts</expan><abbr>Mass.</abbr></choice></placeName>, two officers and sixteen privates died the same day from the same disease.

                    <p>Spanish influenza, rapidly spreading throughout the country, is . . . a highly infectious disease caused by a particularly energetic germ. . . . It is in enormous numbers in the bronchial mucus, whence it is coughed up to renew its pernicious work. . . . It exerts such a general devitalizing effect on the tissue that other dangerous micro-organisms which ordinarily are held in check run riot and catarrh, pneumonia, and similar conditions develop. It particularly attacks overworked and weakened organs such as the heart and lungs. For this reason, rest, nutrition, warmth and tonics are important factors in its treatment.</p>

The <placeName id="#RHSP-0003">Lexington</placeName> Red Cross was organized under <persName id="#RHS-0011"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Merrill Mills</persName> to help meet the emergency. <persName id="#RHS-0004"><abbr>Drs.</abbr> Reuben Frank Davis</persName>, not yet ill, and <persName id="#RHS-0003">Robert Glasgow</persName> <q>âmet the new call with tireless energy and unselfish devotion.â</q>43</p>
                    <p>Cases developed so rapidly that <persName id="#RHS-0012">Miss Annie Jo White</persName>'s home at <placeName id="#RHSP-0034">13 University Place</placeName> was secured as a hospital for twenty patients and staffed with Red Cross helpers. About twenty more cases were segregated and cared for on the <q>âcommodious first floorâ</q> of <placeName id="#RHSP-0026">Castle Hill</placeName>, the hotel west of the campus. A few weeks later, the <placeName id="#RHSP-0092">Blue Hotel</placeName>, also called <placeName id="#RHSP-0092">East Dormitory</placeName>, became a fourth hospital organized under the Red Cross.

                    <p>Some cases were reported among <placeName id="#RHSP-0003">Lexington</placeName> residents.

At the young age of thirty-two, he became one of the first victims of the deadly flu in <placeName id="#RHSP-0003">Lexington</placeName>. He <q>âwas taken to his bed with a severe case of grip, and in a few days pneumonia set in, which developed rapidly and resulted in his deathâ</q> on <date when="1918-10-05">October 5</date> at his home on <placeName id="#RHSP-0035">South Main Street</placeName>.47Because of the epidemic, funeral services were held only at graveside.

                    <p>On the day <persName id="#RHS-0004"><abbr>Dr.</abbr> Davis</persName> died, the <placeName id="#RHSP-0004">Buena Vista</placeName> city council met to discuss the flu situation. <persName id="#RHS-0013"><abbr>Dr.</abbr> James Harmanson Mapp</persName>, board of health president, did not recommend closing schools or churches. On the other hand, <persName id="#RHS-0003"><abbr>Dr.</abbr> Robert Glasgow</persName>, board of health officer for <placeName id="#RHSP-0003">Lexington</placeName>, took immediate action closing <placeName id="#RHSP-0003">Lexington</placeName>'s churches, schools, billiard rooms, and the <soCalled>âpicture showsâ</soCalled> at the <placeName id="#RHSP-0037">Lyric Theatre</placeName> as a <q>âprecautionary measure on account of the prevalence of Spanish influenza in the community.â</q>49 The <bibl><title>County News</title></bibl> quoted him:50</p>
                    <p>This order of the board of health was neither due to the presence of a plague nor a panic in <placeName id="#RHSP-0003">Lexington</placeName>. It was taken simply as a means of wise precaution in view of the spread of an infectious disease, Spanish influenza, over the land which, in cases particularly of the infirm or bodily defective or depleted people and people who do not take proper care of themselves, has been resulting in a per centage of pneumonia, part of the cases of which result fatally.</p>
                    <p>The <bibl><title>County News</title></bibl> reported that on Sunday, <date when="1918-10-06">October 6</date>, <q>âfor the first time that the oldest inhabitant can remember not a church bell sounded a call to worship in <placeName id="#RHSP-0003">Lexington</placeName> . . . . There were neither church services nor Sunday schools.â</q> Few people ventured out. <q>âIt was thought by some that congregating at soda fountains should be prohibited, since the crowds thus assembled were regarded as excellent mediums for the diffusion of the disease.â</q> On that same day, <persName id="#RHS-0014">Grover Cleveland Cummings</persName>, thirty-three, a traveling insurance man, died of pneumonia at the <placeName id="#RHSP-0038">Randolph Street</placeName> home of <persName id="#RHS-0015">Robert Agnor</persName>.51</p>
                    <p>In <placeName id="#RHSP-0004">Buena Vista</placeName>, by contrast, on that Sunday, a great religious revival took place at <placeName id="#RHSP-0039"><abbr>St.</abbr> John's Methodist Church</placeName>. Led by Evangelist <persName id="#RHS-0016">Lee Starke</persName> of <placeName id="#RHSP-0040">New York</placeName>, it resulted in <q>âmore than <num type="cardinal" value="300">three hundred</num> conversions and reclamations.â</q> The meeting concluded a two-week revival, and <q>âevery seat in the church was packed, standing room at a premium and hundreds turned away for lack of room, the most remarkable religious service in the history of <placeName id="#RHSP-0004">Buena Vista</placeName>. . . . The various churches of <placeName id="#RHSP-0004">Buena Vista</placeName> united in the services. Music was a special feature, the large chorus choir being composed of the different choirs of the city.â</q>52</p>
                    <p>The next day, the <placeName id="#RHSP-0004">Buena Vista</placeName> school board voted to close the schools for one week; in the end, schools did not re-open until <date when="1918-11-12">November 12</date>.</p>

                    <p>With separate health boards and temporary health officers, differences in response to the epidemic in <placeName id="#RHSP-0002">Rockbridge County</placeName>, <placeName id="#RHSP-0003">Lexington</placeName>, and <placeName id="#RHSP-0004">Buena Vista</placeName> were typical at the time because of the lack of an organized public health infrastructure at local, state, or federal levels. The influenza epidemic would soon lead to efforts by the state board of health to improve public health capabilities of local jurisdictions.53 <persName id="#RHS-0017"><abbr>Dr.</abbr> Richard Garnett</persName>, assistant commissioner of health, traveled to <placeName id="#RHSP-0003">Lexington</placeName> on <date when="1918-11-19">November 19</date> to propose the establishment of a permanent centralized county health department to replace the three health boards of <placeName id="#RHSP-0003">Lexington</placeName>, <placeName id="#RHSP-0004">Buena Vista</placeName>, and <placeName id="#RHSP-0002">Rockbridge County</placeName>. A large population increase was projected for the area, and the establishment of a permanent department, consisting of a salaried physician, nurses, and sanitation inspectors, would safeguard health in the future. The department would emphasize disease prevention rather than reacting to outbreaks, as was then-current practice. In spite of strong support shown by the women of <placeName id="#RHSP-0003">Lexington</placeName>, the proposal would later be turned down by the County Board of Supervisors.</p>

The lack of news from reliable public health sources during wartime contributed to the fear. The lack of knowledge about the cause of influenza led to much speculation. For example, it was <q>âgenerally acceptedâ</q> that <q>âthe epidemic was originally caused by the bringing of Chinese coolies to do manual labor in the war zone in <placeName id="#RHSP-0027">France</placeName>.â</q>55</p>
                    <p><placeName id="#RHSP-0007">Washington and Lee</placeName> students were quarantined effective <date when="1918-10-07">October 7</date> and were not allowed to go to stores or gather in the streets.56 Throughout the quarantine period in October, the <choice><expan>Student Army Training Corps</expan><abbr>S.A.T.C.</abbr></choice> battalion continued to drill every afternoon for two hours, <q>âthe exercise being considered conducive to healthfulness to void off the influenza.â</q> The battalion marched to the post office at 1 p.m. daily and the men entered the post office <q>âin small relaysâ</q> to get their mail. There were <q>âno longer any student crowds about the post office.â</q>57</p>
                    <p>With the death of one physician, <persName id="#RHS-0004"><abbr>Dr.</abbr> Davis</persName>, and illness of another, <persName id="#RHS-0006"><abbr>Dr.</abbr> McClung</persName>, many afflicted persons could not get proper medical attention.58 <persName id="#RHS-0003"><abbr>Dr.</abbr> Robert Glasgow</persName>, the <placeName id="#RHSP-0003">Lexington</placeName> health officer, wired <placeName id="#RHSP-0041">Washington, <choice><expan>District of Columbia</expan><abbr>D.C.</abbr></choice></placeName>, for help to care for the university students, but every area of the country was in the same predicament.

The Spanish influenza outbreak prompted the county board of supervisors to renew his contract until New Year's, at <measure type ="currency">$500</measure> a year. Cases of influenza were reported throughout the county and a number of schools were already closed because of student and teacher illness.

By <date when="1918-10-17">October 17</date>, there were three cases among cadets. <placeName id="#RHSP-0006"><choice><expan>Virginia Military Institute</expan><abbr>V.M.I.</abbr></choice></placeName> attempted to restrict the spread of infection through strict quarantine at first. The <bibl><title>Lexington Gazette</title></bibl> reported that the situation was never <soCalled>âvery seriousâ</soCalled> at <placeName id="#RHSP-0006"><choice><expan>Virginia Military Institute</expan><abbr>V.M.I.</abbr></choice></placeName>, with few cases because of the quick response and decision to quarantine early in the outbreak. A different picture emerges, however, from the 1918-19 report to the board of visitors, in which <persName id="#RHS-0007">General Nichols</persName> downplayed the epidemic, saying there were <q>âno fatalities, though there were a number quite sick.â</q>65 According to <persName id="#RHS-0007">General Nichols</persName>, the flu was brought back to the barracks when cadets were granted furloughs to visit parents and others at home who had the illness. Absent from <persName id="#RHS-0007"><abbr>Gen.</abbr> Nichols</persName>'s report was any consideration of the fact that sick faculty and staff members on post may have been sources of infection. In short, it is questionable whether quarantine of cadets was an effective strategy at <placeName id="#RHSP-0006"><choice><expan>Virginia Military Institute</expan><abbr>V.M.I.</abbr></choice></placeName></p>
                    <p>Because the <placeName id="#RHSP-0006"><choice><expan>Virginia Military Institute</expan><abbr>V.M.I.</abbr></choice></placeName> hospital was filled with sick cadets, an adjoining vacant house was requisitioned for hospital purposes.66 According to the Superintendent's 1918-19 annual report, <q>âthe conditions occasioned an unusual expense in medical attention and in the number of nurses required,â</q> and an Army doctor was procured. <persName id="#RHS-0007">General Nichols</persName> continued: <q>âOur academic, military, and administrative staffs were also affected. As
                    <pb n="247">
                    we have no supernumerary force, such a condition presents complications not a little embarrassing. Absences of instructors, whether by reason of sickness or for other reasons, should be avoided in every possible way.â</q> <persName id="#RHS-0006"><abbr>Dr.</abbr> O. Hunter McClung</persName>'s annual surgeon's report stated simply: <q>âWe had an unusual number of men throughout the year at sick calls and on the sick list. . . .

                    <p>Two more <placeName id="#RHSP-0002">Rockbridge County</placeName> men died in Army camps on <date when="1918-10-10">October 10</date>: <persName id="#RHS-0026">Nathan Gooch</persName>, <soCalled>âcolored,â</soCalled> at <placeName id="#RHSP-0001">Camp Greene</placeName> in <placeName id="#RHSP-0051">Charlotte, North Carolina</placeName>, and <persName id="#RHS-0027">James Hostetter</persName> at Camp Humphries. Sporadic reports of deaths of <placeName id="#RHSP-0002">Rockbridge County</placeName> men from disease in camps appear throughout the October newspapers. Young women who were teachers in other parts of the country returned to their <placeName id="#RHSP-0003">Lexington</placeName> and <placeName id="#RHSP-0002">Rockbridge County</placeName> homes because the schools where they taught were closed. Parents who were able to do so traveled elsewhere to help care for sick children and relatives. <persName id="#RHS-0028">Graham Robinson</persName> was called to <placeName id="#RHSP-0052">Philadelphia</placeName>, in the middle of that city's crisis68 on <date when="1918-10-12">October 12</date> by news that his son, a chemist at an iron works there, was sick with pneumonia.

                    <p>During the peak of the fall epidemic, court was held, but no juries were called to <q>âprevent the gathering of crowds at the court house during the term, which it is desired to avoid by reason of the influenza epidemic.â</q>69</p>
                    <p>On <date when="1918-10-15">October 15</date>, six deserters were caught hiding out in their homes in <placeName id="#RHSP-0053">Irish Creek</placeName>.

The youthfulness of the victims was probably most alarming to local residents.</p> 
                    <p>A report from the <placeName id="#RHSP-0061">Kerrs Creek</placeName> area of the county read, <q>âWe are lonesome out here; every one stays at home, although the flu hasn't struck many as yet.â</q>72 The full force of the epidemic would not hit there until later.</p>

He died within thirty minutes.73 Of interest, editors of the 1918-19 yearbook included <persName id="#RHS-0044">Donald Spotts</persName> among the fatal influenza cases among students: <q>âOf the more than a hundred and fifty cases of the <soCalled>'flu'</soCalled> only three cases resulted fatally.â</q>74 In actuality, only two students died of influenza.</p>

Every man, woman, and child can help by staying at home as much as possible.â</q>75 Nevertheless, news items about local happenings reported that residents were continuing to travel elsewhere to care for sick family members and relatives.

The <placeName id="#RHSP-0006"><choice><expan>Virginia Military Institute</expan><abbr>VMI</abbr></choice></placeName> took precautions at the very beginning of the epidemic, and when the young men complained of colds or other infirmities they were most carefully looked after. In consequence there were the fewest number of cases of <soCalled>âfluâ</soCalled> at that institution, and the young men emerged from the quarantine healthy and happy. The confinement was a little trying on their spirits but they recognized the wisdom of the precaution.</p>
                    <p>Some residents remained reluctant to gather in public spaces. <q>âThe increased attendance of county people on the streets was noticeable . . . . [Yet] many county people feared to come to town, and as a precaution they remained at home.â</q> On Sunday the 10th, churches re-opened after <num type="cardinal" value="5">five</num> weeks of closed doors. <q>âFairly good congregations attended services.

                    <p>The flu subsided in early March, coincident with the arrival of two blizzards and 8-degree weather.135 Perhaps the blizzards helped by forcing everyone to stay inside.</p>

                <p>Morbidity and mortality statistics were inadequately recorded in most areas of the <placeName id="#RHSP-0011">United States</placeName>.143 It is therefore likely that state and county figures are underestimates.</p>
                <p>The 1918 report of the <placeName id="#RHSP-0032">Virginia</placeName> State Commissioner of Health summarized the impact of the 1918 pandemic in the <placeName id="#RHSP-0011">U.S.</placeName> and in <placeName id="#RHSP-0032">Virginia</placeName>: <q>âOwing to the great epidemic of influenza which began to rage during the latter part of September and reached its height in October, all previous death rates were far surpassed.â</q></p> 
                <p>In a December 1919 diary entry, <persName id="#RHS-0018">Samuel Gibson</persName> of <placeName id="#RHSP-0004">Buena Vista</placeName> wrote, <q>âWe had <num type="cardinal" value="43">forty-three</num> white and <num type="cardinal" value="5">five</num> colored deaths from influenza this Fall.â</q> Comparing those figures with the overall <placeName id="#RHSP-0004">Buena Vista</placeName> population shows a death rate of <num type="percentage" value="1.4">one and four tenths percent</num> percent for whites and <num type="percentage" value="1.3">one and three tenths percent</num> percent for blacks.144 <persName id="#RHS-0075">Crosby</persName> observed that African American civilians had higher death rates from respiratory disease than whites except for the period during the pandemic.145 The <placeName id="#RHSP-0004">Buena Vista</placeName> mortality rates for blacks and whites, however, appeared to be similar.</p>
                <p><persName id="#RHS-0018">Gibson</persName> kept a running tally of deaths since 1890.

Deaths were higher in 1918 for both whites and blacks, although causes of death were not given.146 The 1919 population was <num type="cardinal" value="3250">three thousand two hundred fifty</num>. The numbers of deaths were sixteen whites and nine <soCalled>âcoloredâ</soCalled>; in 1918, comparable numbers were forty and twenty-three â also a <num type="cardinal" value="2.5">two and a half</num>-fold increase in deaths for each race.</p>

                <p>Figure <num type="cardinal" value="18">eighteen</num> shows the ratio of influenza deaths to total deaths from 1917 through 1921. Note the jump in <placeName id="#RHSP-0004">Buena Vista</placeName> flu mortality in 1918.</p>
                <p>Nationally, nearly half of all deaths in 1918 resulted from influenza.147 The <placeName id="#RHSP-0004">Buena Vista</placeName> statistics support the national estimates.

In fact, <placeName id="#RHSP-0002">Rockbridge County</placeName> death rates for influenza, especially during the fall wave in 1918, are possibly underestimates owing to underreporting or failure to determine causes of death accurately.</p>

                <p>A pandemic of the magnitude of the 1918 pandemic would cause economic stress, although the availability of antiviral therapies, vaccines, antibiotics, and rapid identification of cases would have an impact on morbidity and mortality.149 In contrast to the lack of communication in 1918, communication today is much faster due to myriad forces, including internet and social networking.150
                <p><placeName id="#RHSP-0002">Rockbridge County</placeName>, <placeName id="#RHSP-0003">Lexington</placeName>, and <placeName id="#RHSP-0004">Buena Vista</placeName> currently have a total population of about <num type="cardinal" value="35000">thirty-five thousand</num>. Although the attack rate cannot be predicted, if a quarter to a third of the population were affected as it was in 1918, one might expect to see <num type="cardinal" value="9000">nine thousand</num> to <num type="cardinal" value="11000">eleven thousand</num> cases locally. Unfortunately, one cannot predict mortality.*</p>
                <p>There are important lessons to be learned from the 1918 pandemic in <placeName id="#RHSP-0002">Rockbridge County</placeName>. At that time, help from state and federal government was not available; communities had to take care of themselves. This approach included using volunteers and family members as caregivers to compensate for inadequate numbers of medical personnel. Locally, hospitals were improvised, using firehouses, hotels, dormitories, and private residences. Elsewhere in <placeName id="#RHSP-0032">Virginia</placeName>, schools were used as hospitals in some locations and medical students were deployed.152</p>
                <p>Questions regarding pandemic flu planning include whether to send college students home and, if so, when. Statistics on morbidity and mortality in <placeName id="#RHSP-0003">Lexington</placeName>'s two colleges were available only for <placeName id="#RHSP-0007">W&amp;L</placeName>, where <num type="percentage" value="35">thirty-five percent</num> to <num type="percentage" value="40">forty percent</num> percent of the student population fell ill and two students died
