  DURING that fall term 1939, Washington and Lee men were not
oblivious to the news that Europe and Asia were tearing them-
selves apart. In fact, they followed international developments
closely. The faculty, some of whom remembered 1914, made a
special effort, particularly in history courses, to keep their pupils abreast
of the world scene. That autumn saw frequent comments in class on con-
temporary politics and an expanded series of guest lectures on campus.
Most notably, in October 1939, a German sociologist appeared in Lex-
ington to offer his view on the Nazi movement. Student writers in the
Ring-tum-Phi stressed international affairs. For example, Bill "Buck"
Buchanan, later a politics professor at Washington and Lee, wrote a
series on the "Conflagration in Europe."</body>
